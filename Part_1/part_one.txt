🧩Part 1: Introduction and Setup

Tkinter is Python’s standard GUI (Graphic User Interface) toolkit. It is built into Python (No installation needed in most cases).
It lets you make windows, buttons, text boxes, menus e.t.c
It is lightweight and works on Windows, MacOs, and Linux

🧱Setup and Verification
Check Installation.

Most systems already have Tkinter installed. You can verify it by running:


python -m tkinter

If a small window appears - congratulations 🎉 Tkinter is working

Create your first Tkinter Window.


        import tkinter as tk
        # create the main window
        root = tk.Tk()
        # set window title
        root.title(“My First Tkinter App”)
        # set the window size
        root.geometry(“300x200”)
        # create a label widget
        label = tk.Label(root, text=“Hello, Tkinter!” font=(“Arial”, 14))
        label.pack(pady=20)
        #Start the event loop
        root.mainloop()


tk.Tk() creates the main window, we call it root.
.title() sets the title for the window
.geometry(“300x200”) sets the window size. Sets width=300px, height=200px
.Label() creates a text label. It is a widget that displays text.
.pack() places the widget on the window
.mainloop() keeps the window open and listens for user actions

Lay out managers. Tkinter has three layout managers that control where widgets go.

    1. .pack()
       - Packs widgets into a container (like a window) in a simple way.
       - Example: widget.pack(side=“left”)

    2. .grid()
       - Organizes widgets in a table-like structure.
       - Example: widget.grid(row=0, column=1)

    3. .place()
       - Places widgets at an absolute position you specify.
       - Example: widget.place(x=100, y=50)
